      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h3>A neural net for recognizing hand-written numbers</h3>
    I have recently taken the excellent Coursera course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks">Neural Networks for Machine Learning</a> by Geoffrey Hinton. In one of the assignmens various aspects of a neural network for number recognition were studied. To get a feel for the abilities of the neural network, I created this small webapp to experiment with the classifier.
